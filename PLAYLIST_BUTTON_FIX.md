# Playlist Page Comment Button Layout Fix

## Issue
The comment button on the playlist page was extending slightly outside of the card container, causing a layout overflow issue.

## Root Cause
The problem was caused by the interaction between:
1. **Absolute positioning**: The creation date was positioned absolutely in the top-right corner
2. **Flex layout**: The playlist info section used `flex-1` which allowed it to expand to fill available space
3. **No space reservation**: The absolutely positioned element didn't reserve space, allowing content to overlap

## Solution
Applied two CSS fixes to resolve the layout issue:

### 1. Added Right Padding to Playlist Info Container
```tsx
// Before
<div className="flex-1 space-y-4">

// After  
<div className="flex-1 space-y-4 pr-20">
```

**Purpose**: Reserves 5rem (80px) of space on the right side to prevent content from overlapping with the absolutely positioned creation date.

### 2. Added Flex Wrap to Action Buttons
```tsx
// Before
<div className="flex items-center gap-3 pt-2">

// After
<div className="flex items-center gap-3 pt-2 flex-wrap">
```

**Purpose**: Allows buttons to wrap to the next line on smaller screens, preventing horizontal overflow.

## Benefits
- ✅ **Proper containment**: Comment button and other action buttons stay within card boundaries
- ✅ **Responsive design**: Buttons wrap gracefully on smaller screens
- ✅ **Visual balance**: Maintains proper spacing around the creation date
- ✅ **No breaking changes**: Existing functionality remains intact

## Technical Details
- **Right padding value**: `pr-20` (5rem/80px) provides sufficient space for the creation date element
- **Flex wrap**: Ensures responsive behavior without breaking the layout
- **Maintained spacing**: All existing gaps and padding remain consistent

## Testing
- ✅ All existing tests pass
- ✅ Build completes successfully
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ Layout is now properly contained within card boundaries
